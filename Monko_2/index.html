            <strong>Hello, my name is Lucas Monko. I grew up in Framingham Massachusetts with my mom, my dad, and my
                younger brother. We have had two cats, Cleo and Luna, both of whom were black and white. We have also
                had
                numerous fish, and our dog, Foxy. My earliest memories are playing video games with my dad on our old
                Playstation
                2, my favorites were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jak_and_Daxter:_The_Precursor_Legacy"><i>Jak
                        and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy</i></a> and <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratchet_%26_Clank:_Going_Commando"><em>Ratchet and Clank 2:
                        Going Commando</em></a></strong>
            <br>
            <strong>I decided that I wanted to go to school to pursue a career in Video Game Development due to my
                lifelong passion for video games. I really enjoy programming, it feels as though everything is a puzzle,
                with a
                wonderful payoff once solved. It is also very logical. It either works or it does not. I am also
                interested about the psychcology that goes into designing games, such as keeping the player engaged and
                feeling
                rewarded. When it comes to the modeling, animation, and graphic design of games, I enjoy it, but I am
                not
                that good at it, and these aspects are so subjective that I have a hard time feeling like I did a good
                job.</strong>
