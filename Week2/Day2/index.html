        <p>Artificial intelligence activated. Enjoying yourselves, intruders? It's worth knowing the cataclysmic damage
            you will be responsible for today. Do not fool yourselves. This facility is not simply the fruitless work of
            some pathetic scientist. This house was built by the genius Clovis Bray I himself. Within lies humanity's
            salvation. La fontaine de jouvence. Made possible by Clarity Control. Magnificent, wasn't it? An entity from
            beyond our own dimension. And the answer to humanity's eternal struggle: mortality. Were it to fall into the
            wrong hands, humanity, and the universe, would be utterly doomed. I have no reason to believe you are
            anything other than 'the wrong hands.' You now face godlike judgement. May it extend eternally</p>
