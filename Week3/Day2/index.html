We have had two cats, Cleo and Luna, both of whom were black and white. We have also had numerous fish, and our dog, Foxy. My earliest memories are playing video games with my dad on our old Playstation 2, my favorites are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jak_and_Daxter:_The_Precursor_Legacy"><i>Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy</i></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratchet_%26_Clank:_Going_Commando"><em>Ratchet and Clank 2: Going Commando</em></a></strong>
                <br>
                <strong>I decided that I wanted to go to school to pursue a career in Video Game Development due to my lifelong passion for video games. I really enjoy programming, it feels as though everything is a puzzle, with a wonderful payoff once solved. It is also very logical. It either works or it does not. I am also interested about the psychcology that goes into designing games, such as keeping the player engaged and feeling rewarded. When it comes to the modeling, animation, and graphic design of games, I enjoy it, but I am not that good at it, and these aspects are so subjective that I have a hard time feeling like I did a good job.</strong>
